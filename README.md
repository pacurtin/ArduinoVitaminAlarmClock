### ArduinoVitaminAlarmClock

Finally got around to trying out my arduino board.<br>
Uses a realtime clock to activate a stepper motor at a set time each day.<br> 
When the motor is activated it drops an effervescent vitamin tablet into a waiting glass of water.<br>
Might consider adding a solenoid to automatically fill the glass of water too.<br>
